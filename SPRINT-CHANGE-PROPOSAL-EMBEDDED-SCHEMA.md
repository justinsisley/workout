# Sprint Change Proposal: Embedded Schema Architecture Migration

**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Status:** APPROVED  
**Agent:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Change Type:** Major Architectural Transformation

## Executive Summary

This proposal addresses the poor admin user experience created by the current normalized collection structure (Programs → Milestones → Sessions) by migrating to an embedded schema architecture. The change will reduce program creation time from 30+ minutes to <10 minutes while providing a stronger technical foundation for future development.

## 1. Identified Issue Summary

**Problem Statement:**
The current normalized collection structure creates a poor admin user experience requiring constant context switching between 3 different admin interfaces. During Story 1.3 work, it became evident that the milestone and session collections are purely compositional and don't provide real value, while creating significant UX friction. Program creation takes 30+ minutes due to navigation overhead, and admins report this as the most painful part of the system.

**Evidence:**

- Comprehensive analysis in Embedded Schema Product Owner Guide
- Detailed migration plan with 3-day timeline
- Business case showing 83% ROI in first month
- User experience analysis showing 3x improvement in program creation time

## 2. Epic Impact Summary

**Epic 1 (Current):** SIGNIFICANT MODIFICATION

- Story 1.2: Complete rewrite for embedded schema implementation
- Story 1.3: Update admin interface validation for embedded workflow
- Story 1.4: Update data population for embedded structure
- Story 1.1: No changes needed (project setup remains the same)

**Epic 2 (Future):** MINIMAL IMPACT

- Minor data access pattern updates only
- All functionality remains unchanged

**Epic 3 (Future):** MINIMAL IMPACT

- Minor data access pattern updates only
- Product user experience remains identical

**Epic 4 (Future):** MINIMAL IMPACT

- Minor data access pattern updates only
- Advanced features work the same way

**Overall Impact:** Epic 1 becomes stronger with better foundation architecture, while future epics become simpler with embedded data access patterns.
