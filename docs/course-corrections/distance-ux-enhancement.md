# Course Correction: Distance UX Enhancement

**Date:** September 9, 2025  
**Agent:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** Approved and Ready for Multi-Agent Review

## Executive Summary

**Issue:** Current distance-based exercise implementation requires admins to input all distances as raw meters (e.g., "1609" for 1 mile), creating poor user experience for longer distance exercises like running, rucking, and sprints. Additionally, display to end users shows raw meters instead of natural distance formats.

**Solution:** Replace single `distance` field with dual-field approach: `distanceValue` (number) + `distanceUnit` (meters/miles) for intuitive input and semantic display.

**Impact:** Major enhancement to completed Story 1.3 functionality, requiring database schema changes, admin UI redesign, and display logic updates.

## Change Analysis Process

This course correction followed the **Change Navigation Checklist** methodology with incremental review of all impacts.

### Section 1: Trigger & Context ✅

**Triggering Event:** User experience friction discovered during first-time use of completed distance-based exercise support feature.

- **Classification:** Fundamental misunderstanding of existing requirements (UX implications not captured during initial design)
- **Evidence:**
  - Inputting "1609" for 1-mile run is unintuitive and error-prone
  - Mental math required for conversion (20 meters = sprint distance, 1609 meters = 1 mile)
  - Display shows "1609 meters" instead of "1 mile" to end users
- **Current Implementation:** Single `distance: number` field storing raw meters
- **User Impact:** Admin workflow friction and poor end-user experience

### Section 2: Epic Impact Assessment ✅

**Current Epic Status:**

- **Story 1.3** (Admin Interface): Completed with distance field implementation - **requires major modification**
- **Epic 3** (Core Workout Execution): Will need updates to display logic for new dual-field format

**Impact Results:**

- ⚠️ Current epic completed work requires significant rework (not rollback, but enhancement)
- ✅ No epic abandonment needed - enhancement builds on existing architecture
- ⚠️ Future epic (Epic 3) will need display logic updates for dual-field distance format
- ✅ No migration concerns - limited test data can be manually recreated

### Section 3: Artifact Conflict Analysis ✅

**Document Review Results:**

- **PayloadCMS Collections:** ⚠️ Schema change required (breaking change to field structure)
- **Admin UI Architecture:** ⚠️ Input field redesign required (single field → dual field)
- **TypeScript Types:** ⚠️ Generated types will change significantly
- **Course Corrections:** ✅ Previous distance-based exercise support document needs update
- **Story 1.3:** ⚠️ Existing task requires modification for new implementation approach
- **Epic 3:** ⚠️ Display logic assumptions need update for dual-field format

### Section 4: Path Forward Evaluation ✅

**Selected Path:** Enhanced Direct Adjustment with Multi-Agent Review

- **Effort:** Moderate-High (significant rework of recently completed functionality)
- **Risk:** Moderate (breaking changes to schema, requires expert guidance)
- **Feasibility:** High (PayloadCMS supports schema changes, dual fields are standard pattern)
- **Benefits:** Addresses fundamental UX issue, creates future-proof distance handling
- **Alternative Paths Rejected:**
  - Rollback (unnecessary - enhancement, not failure)
  - Re-scoping (within MVP scope, enhances existing functionality)
  - Library parser (less flexible than explicit unit selection)

## Approved Enhancement Plan

### Current vs. Proposed Implementation

#### Current Implementation (Completed)

```typescript
// Database Schema
{
  distance?: number // Raw meters only (e.g., 1609)
}

// Admin Interface
Distance (meters): [1609] // Requires mental math for miles

// Display Logic
"Distance: 1609 meters" // Poor end-user experience
```

#### Proposed Implementation (Enhancement)

```typescript
// Database Schema
{
  distanceValue?: number // The numeric value (e.g., 1)
  distanceUnit?: 'meters' | 'miles' // The distance unit
}

// Admin Interface
Distance: [1] [Miles ▼] // Intuitive for any distance

// Display Logic
"Distance: 1 mile" // Natural reading experience
```

### Database Schema Changes

**File:** `src/payload/collections/programs.ts`

**REMOVE existing field (lines 326-337):**

```typescript
{
  name: 'distance',
  type: 'number',
  label: 'Distance (meters)',
  min: 0,
  max: 10000,
  admin: {
    description: 'Distance in meters for distance-based exercises (optional)',
    placeholder: 'e.g., 20 for sprints, 1609 for 1-mile run',
    step: 1,
  },
}
```

**ADD new dual fields:**

```typescript
{
  name: 'distanceValue',
  type: 'number',
  label: 'Distance Value',
  min: 0,
  max: 999,
  admin: {
    description: 'Distance value for distance-based exercises (use with distance unit)',
    placeholder: 'e.g., 20, 1, 5',
    step: 0.1,
    condition: (_, siblingData) => Boolean(siblingData?.distanceUnit),
  },
},
{
  name: 'distanceUnit',
  type: 'select',
  label: 'Distance Unit',
  options: [
    { label: 'Meters', value: 'meters' },
    { label: 'Miles', value: 'miles' },
  ],
  admin: {
    description: 'Distance unit for distance value (required if distance value is set)',
  },
}
```

### Story 1.3 Task Modifications

**File:** `docs/stories/1.3.admin-interface-and-program-creation.md`

## Technical Specifications

### Data Model Enhancement

**Field Definitions:**

| Field           | Type                | Purpose                 | Validation       |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `distanceValue` | `number` (optional) | Numeric distance value  | 0-999, step: 0.1 |
| `distanceUnit`  | `select` (optional) | Distance unit selection | meters/miles     |

**Validation Rules:**

- If `distanceValue` is set, `distanceUnit` must be selected
- If `distanceUnit` is selected, `distanceValue` must be provided
- Reasonable maximums per unit: 999 meters, 999 miles
- Both fields optional for exercises that don't need distance

**Examples:**

```typescript
// Sprint exercise
{ distanceValue: 20, distanceUnit: 'meters' }

// 1-mile run
{ distanceValue: 1, distanceUnit: 'miles' }

// 5-mile ruck march
{ distanceValue: 5, distanceUnit: 'miles' }

// Traditional strength exercise (no distance component)
{ distanceValue: null, distanceUnit: null }
```

### Admin Interface Requirements

**Field Layout:**

```
Exercise Configuration Row:
[Exercise ▼] [Sets: 3] [Reps: 10] [Rest: 60s] [Weight: 25lbs] [Duration: 1hr] [Distance: 1] [Miles ▼] [Notes...]
```

**Visual Grouping:**

- Distance value and unit selector should appear as paired fields
- Visual indication that both fields work together
- Conditional display logic (unit dropdown appears when value entered)
- Clear validation feedback for incomplete distance specifications

**Input Patterns:**

- **Distance Value:** Standard number input with placeholder text and decimal precision
- **Distance Unit:** Dropdown with two options (Meters, Miles)
- **Default Behavior:** No defaults selected (both fields start empty)
- **Validation:** Real-time feedback if one field filled without the other

### Display Logic Architecture

**Utility Function Required:**

```typescript
function formatDistance(value?: number, unit?: string): string {
  if (!value || !unit) return ''

  // Handle singular vs plural
  if (value === 1 && unit === 'miles') {
    return `${value} mile`
  }
  if (value === 1 && unit === 'meters') {
    return `${value} meter`
  }
  return `${value} ${unit}`
}

// Examples:
// formatDistance(20, 'meters') → "20 meters"
// formatDistance(1, 'miles') → "1 mile"
// formatDistance(5, 'miles') → "5 miles"
```

**Display Contexts:**

1. **Admin Interface:** Show as entered (preserve user's intent)
2. **Workout Execution:** Show in most appropriate unit for context
3. **Progress Tracking:** Maintain original units for consistency
4. **Export/Reporting:** Include both value and unit for clarity

### Database Impact

**Schema Changes:**

- ✅ No data migration required (limited test data will be recreated)
- ⚠️ Breaking change to field structure (distance → distanceValue + distanceUnit)
- ✅ PayloadCMS handles schema updates automatically
- ⚠️ TypeScript types will regenerate with new field structure

**Backwards Compatibility:**

- Not applicable (test data only, no production data)
- New programs use dual-field approach
- Old distance field references in code must be updated
