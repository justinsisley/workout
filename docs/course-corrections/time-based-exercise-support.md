# Course Correction: Time-Based Exercise Support

**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Agent:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** Approved and Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

**Issue:** Exercise data model lacks support for time-based duration (seconds/minutes), forcing users to put critical time data in notes field when logging exercises like planks, timed runs, and endurance workouts.

**Solution:** Add optional `duration` field to existing embedded exercise schema in PayloadCMS Programs collection.

**Impact:** Minimal change with high value - single field addition that aligns perfectly with Epic 3's time tracking requirements.

---

## Change Analysis Process

This course correction followed the **Change Navigation Checklist** methodology with incremental review of all impacts.

### Section 1: Trigger & Context ✅

**Triggering Event:** Discovered limitation while using CMS to add plank exercise

- **Classification:** Newly discovered requirement (not technical limitation)
- **Evidence:** Time-based exercises are common (planks, runs, hanging exercises, bike rides, rowing)
- **Current Workaround:** Users forced to put time data in notes field
- **User Impact:** Compromised data quality and user experience

### Section 2: Epic Impact Assessment ✅

**Current Epic Status:**

- **Story 1.2** (Ready for Review): Embedded data structure - needs `duration` field addition
- **Story 1.3** (Ready for Development): Admin interface - needs time input field

**Impact Results:**

- ✅ Current epic can be completed with minor modifications
- ✅ No epic abandonment needed - additive change fits existing architecture
- ✅ No future epic conflicts - Epic 3 already specifies time tracking as requirement

### Section 3: Artifact Conflict Analysis ✅

**Document Review Results:**

- **PRD:** ✅ No conflicts - Epic 3 Story 3.3 already specifies time data entry
- **Architecture:** ✅ PayloadCMS embedded schema easily supports field addition
- **Frontend Spec:** ✅ Already includes time as core data entry requirement

**Only Update Needed:** Story 1.2 embedded exercise schema

### Section 4: Path Forward Evaluation ✅

**Selected Path:** Direct Adjustment / Integration

- **Effort:** Minimal (single field addition)
- **Risk:** Very Low (optional field, backwards compatible)
- **Feasibility:** High (PayloadCMS makes this trivial)
- **Alternative Paths Rejected:** Rollback (unnecessary), Re-scoping (not needed)

## Approved Implementation Plan

### Story 1.2 Changes: PayloadCMS Collections and Embedded Data Structure

**Schema Update (Programs Collection):**

```typescript
// BEFORE (lines 115-122)
exercises?: {
  exercise: string // Reference to Exercise ID
  sets: number
  reps: number
  restPeriod?: number // Rest time between sets (seconds)
  weight?: number // Weight to use (lbs)
  notes?: string // Additional instructions
}[]

// AFTER (Updated Schema)
exercises?: {
  exercise: string // Reference to Exercise ID
  sets: number
  reps: number
  restPeriod?: number // Rest time between sets (seconds)
  weight?: number // Weight to use (lbs)
  duration?: number // Exercise duration in seconds (for time-based exercises)
  notes?: string // Additional instructions
}[]
```

**Additional Dev Notes Section:**

```markdown
**Time-Based Exercise Support:**

- **Duration Field:** Optional `duration` field supports time-based exercises (planks, runs, endurance workouts)
- **Units:** Duration stored in seconds for consistency with `restPeriod` field
- **Admin Interface:** Time input with seconds/minutes conversion for user-friendly entry
- **Use Cases:**
  - Plank: 1 set, 1 rep, 30 seconds duration
  - Timed run: 1 set, 1 rep, 300 seconds duration (5 minutes)
  - Sprint intervals: 1 set, 1 rep, 30 seconds duration
```

### Story 1.3 Changes: Admin Interface and Program Creation

**New Task Addition:**

```markdown
- [ ] **Time duration input field** (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add duration field to exercise configuration within embedded days
  - [ ] Implement seconds/minutes input with conversion to seconds storage
  - [ ] Show duration field alongside sets, reps, weight fields
  - [ ] Add field description: "Duration in seconds for time-based exercises (optional)"
```

**Additional Dev Notes Section:**

```markdown
### Time Duration Field Implementation

**Admin Interface Requirements:**

- Duration input field appears in exercise configuration within workout days
- Input accepts both seconds (30s) and minutes:seconds (5:30) formats
- Converts all input to seconds for database storage
- Field appears alongside existing sets, reps, weight, notes fields
- Optional field with clear labeling for time-based exercises
- Consistent with existing `restPeriod` field implementation pattern
```

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

**Risk Level:** Very Low

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Admin Interface Complexity:** Adding another input field
   - **Mitigation:** Follow existing field patterns, optional field reduces complexity
2. **User Confusion:** When to use duration vs other fields
   - **Mitigation:** Clear labeling, helper text, and field descriptions
3. **Data Consistency:** Different time units causing confusion
   - **Mitigation:** Always store in seconds, handle conversion in UI layer

4. **Backwards Compatibility:** Existing programs without duration field
   - **Mitigation:** Optional field ensures no breaking changes

### Rollback Plan

**If Issues Arise:**

1. **Database:** Remove duration field from PayloadCMS schema (non-breaking)
2. **Code:** Revert admin interface changes
3. **Data:** Optional field means no data corruption risk
4. **Timeline:** Can be rolled back within same sprint without impact
