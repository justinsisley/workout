# Personal Workout App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

Based on your project brief and brainstorming session, here are the key desired outcomes for this PRD:

- **Replace paper-based workout tracking** with a digital solution optimized for mobile gym use
- **Enable admin-driven program creation** through PayloadCMS interface for easy workout program management
- **Provide smart progression logic** with automatic regression rules to maintain motivation and consistency
- **Support shared household access** allowing both Justin and his wife to use the same programs simultaneously
- **Deliver mobile-first gym experience** with optimized UI for phone use during workout sessions
- **Establish unified PayloadCMS ecosystem** for consistent data management and future extensibility
- **Create structured fitness progression** with clear program hierarchy (Programs → Milestones → Weeks → Days → Sessions)
- **Enable real data foundation** from day one without mock data requirements

### Background Context

This Personal Workout App addresses a specific gap in the fitness tracking market for personal household use. Current solutions - whether paper-based logs or commercial fitness apps - fail to meet the unique needs of fitness enthusiasts who want structured, progressive workout programs with the flexibility to create and modify programs easily.

The project emerged from a comprehensive brainstorming session that identified key pain points: paper logs lack structure and shareability, commercial apps are bloated with irrelevant features, and existing solutions aren't optimized for mobile gym use. The solution leverages a unified PayloadCMS ecosystem to provide admin-driven program creation (like creating blog posts) combined with smart progression logic that automatically handles workout gaps through regression rules.

This approach creates a natural motivation system where skipping days results in losing progress rather than just pausing, encouraging consistency while maintaining the flexibility needed for real-world fitness routines.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The workout app will deliver a **mobile-first, gym-optimized experience** that prioritizes simplicity and utility over complexity. The interface will be designed for one-handed operation during actual workout sessions, with large touch targets, minimal cognitive load, and immediate access to essential information. The design philosophy centers on "dead simple" interactions - users should be able to complete workouts without thinking about the interface, focusing entirely on their fitness goals.

The visual design will be clean and distraction-free, avoiding gamification elements or unnecessary visual flourishes. Typography and spacing will be optimized for quick scanning during physical exertion, with high contrast and clear hierarchy. The interface will feel like a natural extension of the workout experience rather than a separate digital tool.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Touch-First Navigation:** All interactions optimized for thumb navigation with large, easily accessible buttons and minimal scrolling requirements.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Information revealed contextually - users see only what they need for the current exercise, with easy access to additional details when needed.

**Quick Data Entry:** Optimized input patterns for numbers (reps, sets, weight) with smart defaults and auto-completion based on previous sessions.

**Video Integration:** Seamless inline video playback with instant fullscreen toggle, designed for quick reference during exercises.

**Session Flow:** Linear progression through workout sessions with clear completion states and easy navigation between exercises.

### Core Screens and Views

**SMS Authentication Screen** - Simple phone number input with SMS OTP verification

**Program Selection Screen** - Clean list of available workout programs with descriptions

**Workout Dashboard** - Current day overview showing exercises, estimated duration, and progress

**Exercise Detail Screen** - Primary workout interface with video, sets/reps tracking, and completion controls

**Progress Tracking Screen** - Historical workout data and current program position

**Admin Dashboard** - PayloadCMS interface for program creation and management (desktop-optimized)

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The app will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure usability for users with disabilities. This includes proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for exercise videos. Touch targets will meet minimum size requirements, and the interface will support voice-over and other assistive technologies commonly used on mobile devices.

### Branding

The app will maintain a **minimalist, utility-focused aesthetic** that emphasizes function over form. Color palette will be neutral and calming (grays, whites, subtle accent colors) to avoid distraction during workouts. Typography will be clean and highly readable, with emphasis on clarity over stylistic elements. The overall feel should be professional and trustworthy, like a well-designed tool rather than a consumer entertainment app.

### Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only

The primary interface is designed exclusively for mobile devices, specifically optimized for phone use during gym sessions. While the PayloadCMS admin interface will be accessible on desktop for program creation, the user-facing workout interface is mobile-only. The design will target modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet) with responsive design principles, but the primary use case is portrait orientation on phones during actual workout sessions.

## Technical Assumptions
