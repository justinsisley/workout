# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure + Data Population

**Epic Goal:** Establish the complete technical foundation for the Personal Workout App, including PayloadCMS integration, data structure implementation, and population with the first complete workout program. This epic delivers a fully functional admin interface for program creation and management, along with realistic data that enables effective development of user-facing features in subsequent epics.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Environment

As a **developer**,
I want **a complete development environment with Next.js, PayloadCMS, MongoDB, and comprehensive development tooling**,
so that **I can begin building the workout app with all necessary tools, quality assurance, and infrastructure**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Next.js application is initialized** with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN components configured
2. **PayloadCMS is integrated** and running locally with MongoDB connection and TypeScript support
3. **Docker Compose setup** provides local MongoDB instance for development
4. **Git repository is initialized** with proper .gitignore and initial commit
5. **TypeScript configuration** is properly set up with strict type checking and path aliases
6. **Code quality tools are configured** including ESLint, Prettier, and/or Biome for consistent code formatting
7. **Testing framework is set up** with Vitest for unit/integration tests and Playwright for E2E testing
8. **Pre-commit hooks are configured** using Husky to run type checks, linting, and tests before commits
9. **Development scripts are configured** for easy local development startup, testing, and building
10. **Basic project structure** follows monorepo pattern with clear separation of concerns
11. **Environment variables** are properly configured for local development with type safety
12. **Health check endpoint** is available to verify all services are running
13. **CI/CD pipeline foundation** is established for automated testing and deployment (GitHub Actions or similar)
14. **Code coverage reporting** is configured to track test coverage across the project

## Story 1.2: PayloadCMS Collections and Data Structure

As a **developer**,
I want **all PayloadCMS collections defined with proper relationships**,
so that **the data structure supports the complete program hierarchy and user management**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Exercises collection** includes title, description, video URL, and alternatives
2. **Programs collection** includes name, description, objective, culminating event, and milestone relationships
3. **Milestones collection** includes name, theme, objective, culminating event, and days array with relationship-based ordering
4. **Days are embedded in milestones** with dayType ('workout'|'rest'), sessions array, and relationship-based ordering (day number derived from array position)
5. **Sessions collection** includes exercises with sets, reps, and rest periods
6. **Product users collection** includes phone number, current program, milestone, and day tracking
7. **Exercise completions collection** includes user, exercise, reps, sets, weight, time, and date
8. **All relationships are properly configured** between collections
9. **Collection validation rules** ensure data integrity and required fields

## Story 1.3: Admin Interface and Program Creation

As an **admin user**,
I want **a functional PayloadCMS admin interface**,
so that **I can create and manage workout programs, exercises, and program structure**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Admin authentication** works with PayloadCMS built-in user system
2. **Program creation interface** allows creating new programs with all required fields
3. **Exercise library management** enables adding, editing, and organizing exercises
4. **Milestone creation** allows defining themes, objectives, and culminating events
5. **Day management** enables creating the complete program structure with embedded days in milestones
6. **Session creation** allows adding exercises with sets, reps, and rest periods
7. **Rest day management** provides simple checkbox for marking days as rest days
8. **Data validation** prevents invalid program structures and missing required fields
9. **Admin interface is responsive** and works on desktop for program creation
10. **All CRUD operations** work correctly for all collection types

## Story 1.4: Complete Program Data Population

As a **developer**,
I want **the first complete workout program populated with real data**,
so that **I have realistic data for testing and development of user-facing features**.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. **Exercise library is populated** with at least 20 diverse exercises covering various movement patterns
2. **Complete program structure** is created with realistic milestones and days
3. **All sessions include exercises** with appropriate sets, reps, and rest periods
4. **Program hierarchy is validated** - all relationships work correctly from program to individual exercises
5. **Realistic program content** reflects actual workout programming principles
6. **Video URLs are included** for exercise demonstrations (can be placeholder URLs initially)
7. **Alternative exercises are defined** for key exercises where substitutions make sense
8. **Program duration estimates** are realistic and based on actual session content
9. **Data export/import** functionality works for backup and future program creation
10. **Admin can view complete program** structure and make modifications as needed
