4. **Passkey authentication** enables secure login using registered passkeys
5. **User session management** maintains authenticated state across app usage
6. **Username storage** securely stores user usernames as unique identifiers
7. **Passkey credential storage** securely stores WebAuthN credentials
8. **Rate limiting** prevents abuse of the authentication system
9. **Error handling** provides clear feedback for invalid usernames or authentication failures
10. **Mobile optimization** includes touch-friendly interface optimized for mobile devices
11. **Security measures** implement proper session management and data protection
12. **Browser compatibility** ensures WebAuthN works across supported browsers

## Story 2.2: Product User Management

As a **system administrator**,
I want **to manage product users and their passkey authentication data**,
so that **I can track user accounts and ensure proper access control**.

### Story 2.2 Acceptance Criteria

1. **Product users collection** stores usernames, passkey credentials, authentication status, and user metadata
2. **User creation** automatically creates product user records upon successful passkey registration
3. **User lookup** efficiently finds users by username for authentication
4. **User status tracking** maintains current authentication and account status
5. **Data validation** ensures usernames are properly formatted and unique
6. **User management interface** allows admins to view and manage product users
7. **Security compliance** implements proper data protection for username and passkey credential storage
8. **User session tracking** maintains current user state and authentication status
9. **Error handling** gracefully handles duplicate users and authentication failures
10. **Data integrity** ensures user data consistency across authentication flows

## Story 2.3: Program Selection Interface

As a **product user**,
I want **to view and select from available workout programs**,
so that **I can choose the program that best fits my fitness goals and current level**.

### Story 2.3 Acceptance Criteria

1. **Program list display** shows all available workout programs with names and descriptions
2. **Program details view** displays program objectives and estimated duration
3. **Program selection** allows users to choose and confirm their selected program
4. **User program assignment** stores the selected program for the authenticated user
5. **Program status tracking** maintains user's current program selection and progress
6. **Mobile optimization** provides touch-friendly interface optimized for phone use
7. **Program filtering** allows users to filter programs by difficulty, duration, or focus area
8. **Program preview** shows program structure (milestones, estimated duration)
9. **Selection confirmation** requires user confirmation before program assignment
10. **Error handling** gracefully handles program selection failures and provides user feedback

## Story 2.4: User Progress Initialization

As a **product user**,
I want **my progress to be properly initialized when I select a program**,
so that **I can begin my fitness journey from the correct starting point**.

### Story 2.4 Acceptance Criteria

1. **Progress initialization** sets user's current program, milestone, and day to starting values
2. **Program structure validation** ensures selected program has valid structure before assignment
3. **User progress tracking** maintains current position within selected program
4. **Progress persistence** saves user progress data to database for future sessions
5. **Program completion tracking** enables tracking of overall program progress
6. **Milestone progression** allows users to advance through program milestones
7. **Day progression** enables users to move through program days and exercises
8. **Progress validation** ensures user progress data is consistent with program structure
9. **Error handling** gracefully handles program structure issues and progress conflicts
10. **Data integrity** maintains consistent user progress data across all operations
