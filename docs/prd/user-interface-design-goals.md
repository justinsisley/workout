# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The workout app will deliver a **mobile-first, gym-optimized experience** that prioritizes simplicity and utility over complexity. The interface will be designed for one-handed operation during actual workout sessions, with large touch targets, minimal cognitive load, and immediate access to essential information. The design philosophy centers on "dead simple" interactions - users should be able to complete workouts without thinking about the interface, focusing entirely on their fitness goals.

The visual design will be clean and distraction-free, avoiding gamification elements or unnecessary visual flourishes. Typography and spacing will be optimized for quick scanning during physical exertion, with high contrast and clear hierarchy. The interface will feel like a natural extension of the workout experience rather than a separate digital tool.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

**Touch-First Navigation:** All interactions optimized for thumb navigation with large, easily accessible buttons and minimal scrolling requirements.

**Progressive Disclosure:** Information revealed contextually - users see only what they need for the current exercise, with easy access to additional details when needed.

**Quick Data Entry:** Optimized input patterns for numbers (reps, sets, weight) with smart defaults and auto-completion based on previous sessions.

**Video Integration:** Seamless inline video playback with instant fullscreen toggle, designed for quick reference during exercises.

**Session Flow:** Linear progression through workout sessions with clear completion states and easy navigation between exercises.

## Core Screens and Views

**Passkey Authentication Screen** - Username input with WebAuthn passkey registration and authentication

**Program Selection Screen** - Clean list of available workout programs with descriptions

**Workout Dashboard** - Current day overview showing exercises, estimated duration, and progress

**Exercise Detail Screen** - Primary workout interface with video, sets/reps tracking, and completion controls

**Progress Tracking Screen** - Historical workout data and current program position

**Admin Dashboard** - PayloadCMS interface for program creation and management (desktop-optimized)

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The app will meet WCAG AA standards to ensure usability for users with disabilities. This includes proper color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation support, screen reader compatibility, and alternative text for exercise videos. Touch targets will meet minimum size requirements, and the interface will support voice-over and other assistive technologies commonly used on mobile devices.

## Branding

The app will maintain a **minimalist, utility-focused aesthetic** that emphasizes function over form. Color palette will be neutral and calming (grays, whites, subtle accent colors) to avoid distraction during workouts. Typography will be clean and highly readable, with emphasis on clarity over stylistic elements. The overall feel should be professional and trustworthy, like a well-designed tool rather than a consumer entertainment app.

## Target Device and Platforms: Mobile Only

The primary interface is designed exclusively for mobile devices, specifically optimized for phone use during gym sessions. While the PayloadCMS admin interface will be accessible on desktop for program creation, the user-facing workout interface is mobile-only. The design will target modern mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile, Samsung Internet) with responsive design principles, but the primary use case is portrait orientation on phones during actual workout sessions.
