# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

Based on your project brief and brainstorming session, here are the key desired outcomes for this PRD:

- **Replace paper-based workout tracking** with a digital solution optimized for mobile gym use
- **Enable admin-driven program creation** through PayloadCMS interface for easy workout program management
- **Provide smart progression logic** with automatic regression rules to maintain motivation and consistency
- **Support shared household access** allowing both Justin and his wife to use the same programs simultaneously
- **Deliver mobile-first gym experience** with optimized UI for phone use during workout sessions
- **Establish unified PayloadCMS ecosystem** for consistent data management and future extensibility
- **Create structured fitness progression** with clear program hierarchy (Programs → Milestones → Days → Sessions)
- **Enable real data foundation** from day one without mock data requirements

## Background Context

This Personal Workout App addresses a specific gap in the fitness tracking market for personal household use. Current solutions - whether paper-based logs or commercial fitness apps - fail to meet the unique needs of fitness enthusiasts who want structured, progressive workout programs with the flexibility to create and modify programs easily.

The project emerged from a comprehensive brainstorming session that identified key pain points: paper logs lack structure and shareability, commercial apps are bloated with irrelevant features, and existing solutions aren't optimized for mobile gym use. The solution leverages a unified PayloadCMS ecosystem to provide admin-driven program creation (like creating blog posts) combined with smart progression logic that automatically handles workout gaps through regression rules.

This approach creates a natural motivation system where skipping days results in losing progress rather than just pausing, encouraging consistency while maintaining the flexibility needed for real-world fitness routines.
