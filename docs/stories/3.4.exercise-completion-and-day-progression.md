# Story 3.4: Exercise Completion and Day Progression

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** product user,  
**I want** to complete exercises and progress through my workout day,  
**so that** I can finish my workout and advance to the next day or milestone.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Exercise completion** allows users to mark exercises as completed with logged data, with round-based completion for AMRAP workouts
2. **Day progression** automatically advances to the next exercise in the day, with round restart flow for AMRAP workouts  
3. **Day completion** detects when all exercises are completed and marks day as done, with time-based completion for AMRAP days
4. **AMRAP round management** handles round completion and automatic cycling back to first exercise until time expires
5. **Progress updates** updates user's current position within the program structure
6. **Day advancement** automatically advances to the next day when current day is completed
7. **Milestone progression** advances to next milestone when all days in current milestone are completed
8. **Completion confirmation** requires user confirmation before marking exercises as complete
9. **Progress persistence** saves all progress updates to database immediately
10. **Error handling** gracefully handles progression failures and data conflicts
11. **Data integrity** ensures consistent progress tracking across all operations

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** [From Story 3.3 completion]
- Comprehensive workout data entry and tracking components are now available
- Real-time saving with auto-save functionality is implemented
- AMRAP round tracking with partial completion is working
- Exercise completion status tracking is integrated with workout store
- Mobile-optimized UI patterns with touch-friendly interactions established

**State Management:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#zustand-store-structure]
```typescript
// Enhanced workout store interface available:
interface WorkoutState {
  currentProgram: Program | null
  currentMilestoneIndex: number
  currentDayIndex: number
  currentExerciseIndex: number
  completedExercises: string[]
  sessionStartTime: Date | null
  exerciseProgress: Record<string, ExerciseProgress>
  // Methods available for progression:
  completeExercise: (exerciseId: string) => void
  advanceToNextExercise: () => void
  completeDay: () => void
  advanceToNextDay: () => void
  getCurrentDay: () => EmbeddedDay | null
  getCurrentExercise: () => Exercise | null
}

interface ExerciseProgress {
  exerciseId: string
  completionPercentage: number
  isCompleted: boolean
  completedData?: WorkoutDataEntry | AmrapDataEntry
}
```

**Data Models:** [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#programs-collection]
```typescript
// Program structure with embedded milestones and days
interface Program {
  id: string
  milestones: EmbeddedMilestone[]
}

interface EmbeddedMilestone {
  id: string
  name: string
  days: EmbeddedDay[]
}

interface EmbeddedDay {
  id: string
  dayType: 'workout' | 'rest'
  isAmrap?: boolean
  amrapDuration?: number
  exercises?: ExerciseConfig[]
}

// ProductUser progress tracking
interface ProductUser {
  currentProgram: string
  currentMilestone: number
  currentDay: number
  lastWorkoutDate: Date
  totalWorkoutsCompleted: number
}
```

**Server Actions Specifications:** [Source: architecture/server-actions-specification.md#workout-execution-server-actions]
- Use PayloadCMS Local API for all data operations with full type safety
- Server actions pattern: `completeExercise`, `advanceToNextDay`, `updateUserProgress`
- Implement proper error handling with Zod validation
- Use `revalidatePath` for cache invalidation after progress updates

**AMRAP Day Management:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#type-safety-patterns]
```typescript
// Use existing AMRAP detection
export function isAmrapDay(day: EmbeddedDay): day is EmbeddedDay & { isAmrap: true; amrapDuration: number } {
  return Boolean(day.isAmrap && day.amrapDuration)
}

// AMRAP completion logic:
// - Round completion cycles back to first exercise
// - Time-based completion when timer reaches zero
// - Track total rounds completed and partial rounds
```

**Progress Persistence Pattern:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#payloadcms-local-api-data-access]
```typescript
// Server action for updating product user progress
export async function updateUserProgress(
  productUserId: string,
  progress: {
    currentMilestone?: number
    currentDay?: number
    lastWorkoutDate?: Date
    totalWorkoutsCompleted?: number
  }
) {
  const payload = await getPayload()
  return await payload.update({
    collection: 'productUsers',
    id: productUserId,
    data: progress
  })
}
```

**Mobile Optimization Requirements:** [From Story 3.1-3.3 patterns]
- Apply mobile-first responsive design with 44px minimum touch targets
- Use high-contrast colors and clear visual hierarchy for gym visibility
- Implement touch-manipulation CSS for reduced input delays
- Ensure one-handed operation capability for all completion flows
- Add haptic feedback patterns where supported for completion confirmations

**Data Validation:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Use Zod schemas for all progress update validation
- Implement range checking for milestone/day indices
- Add data integrity checks before advancing to prevent inconsistent states
- Server actions must validate user authentication and program access

**Error Handling Strategy:** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]
- All server actions use proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Frontend components handle loading states and error boundaries
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for network failures
- Add offline capability with local storage for progress tracking
