## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
No previous story files exist - this is the first story being prepared.

### PayloadCMS Collections Architecture
[Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md]

**Programs Collection with Embedded Structure:**
- Programs use embedded architecture with milestones and days nested within single document
- Single-page editing eliminates context switching between collections
- Progressive validation allows saving incomplete content while preventing publishing incomplete data
- `isPublished` boolean controls product user visibility

**Program Structure:**
```typescript
interface Program {
  id: string
  name?: string // Optional - can be saved without name initially
  description?: string // Optional - can be saved without description initially
  objective?: string // Optional - can be saved without objective initially
  milestones: {
    name?: string
    theme?: string
    objective?: string
    days: {
      dayType: 'workout' | 'rest'
      exercises?: {
        exercise: string // Reference to Exercise ID
        sets: number
        reps: number
        restPeriod?: number // Rest time between sets (seconds)
        weight?: number // Weight to use (lbs)
        durationValue?: number // Duration numeric value (e.g., 1, 30, 5)
        durationUnit?: 'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' // Duration time unit
        notes?: string // Additional instructions
      }[]
      restNotes?: string
    }[]
  }[]
  isPublished: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Exercises Collection:**
```typescript
interface Exercise {
  id: string
  title?: string // Optional - can be saved without title initially
  description?: string // Optional - can be saved without description initially
  videoUrl?: string // Optional - can be saved without video initially
  alternatives: string[] // Reference to other Exercise IDs
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Time-Based Exercise Support:**
- Use dual-field approach: `durationValue` (number) + `durationUnit` ('seconds'|'minutes'|'hours')
- Both fields required together with contextual validation
- Examples: Plank (30 seconds), Timed run (5 minutes), Ruck march (1 hour)

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**PayloadCMS Configuration Location:**
- Collection definitions: `src/payload/collections/`
- Programs collection: `src/payload/collections/programs.ts`
- Exercises collection: `src/payload/collections/exercises.ts`
- PayloadCMS config: `src/payload/payload.config.ts`

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Required Technologies:**
- PayloadCMS 3.53+ for headless CMS
- MongoDB 7.0+ for document database (perfect for complex program hierarchies)
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- YouTube API for video integration (use YouTube URLs for exercise videos)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Philosophy:**
- Do NOT test PayloadCMS collection configurations (framework already tested)
- Do NOT test PayloadCMS admin UI or CRUD operations
- DO test custom business logic and data validation
- DO test integration points between our code and PayloadCMS

**Test Location:**
- Backend tests: `tests/payload/`
- Collection tests: `tests/payload/collections.test.ts`
- PayloadCMS client tests: `tests/payload/payload-client.test.ts`

**Test Framework:**
- Use Vitest for backend testing
- Test data export/import functionality
- Test custom validation logic
- Test performance with realistic program sizes

### Testing
**Story-Specific Test Cases:**

**Data Population Validation Tests:**
- Test creation of 20+ exercises with all required fields populated
- Validate exercise library covers all movement patterns (push, pull, squat, hinge, carry, core)
- Test alternative exercise relationships are properly linked
- Verify video URLs are valid format (YouTube URL structure)
- Test embedded program structure creation with 3-4 milestones
- Validate embedded days contain appropriate workout/rest day mix
- Test exercise assignment to days with all required fields (sets, reps, rest, weight, notes)
- Verify time-based exercises use both durationValue and durationUnit correctly

**Performance Testing with Concrete Benchmarks:**
- **Realistic Program Size Definition:** Programs with 4 milestones, 56 total days (8 weeks), 32 workout days, 160 total exercise assignments
- **Performance Benchmarks:**
  - Program loading: < 2 seconds for complete embedded structure
  - Single-page editing: < 500ms response time for program updates
  - Data export: < 5 seconds for full program export
  - Data import: < 10 seconds for full program import
  - Memory usage: < 50MB for loaded program in admin interface
- Test performance degradation with 2x, 5x, and 10x realistic program sizes
- Validate MongoDB query performance with embedded document retrieval

**Data Integrity Validation Tests:**
- Test embedded relationship integrity from program → milestones → days → exercises
- Validate exercise references point to existing Exercise collection documents
- Test data consistency after export/import cycle
- Verify progressive validation allows saving incomplete programs
- Test published/unpublished program visibility logic

**Admin Interface Workflow Testing:**
- Test single-page editing workflow with populated program data
- Validate admin can navigate complete embedded program structure
- Test adding/removing exercises from days within program
- Test milestone creation/deletion within program
- Verify changes persist correctly across page reloads
- Test bulk operations on program structure

### Data Export/Import Specifications
**Critical Implementation Requirements for AC #9:**

**Export Data Format:**
- **Format:** JSON structure matching PayloadCMS document schema
- **File naming:** `program-export-{programId}-{timestamp}.json`
- **Content structure:**
```typescript
interface ProgramExport {
  version: string // Export format version for future compatibility
  exportDate: string // ISO timestamp
  program: Program // Complete embedded program document
  exercises: Exercise[] // All referenced exercises with full details
  metadata: {
    totalExercises: number
    totalMilestones: number
    totalDays: number
    workoutDays: number
  }
}
```

**Export Scope:**
- **Full Programs:** Complete program with all embedded milestones, days, and exercise references
- **Referenced Exercises:** All Exercise collection documents referenced by the program
- **Relationships:** Maintain all embedded and referenced relationships
- **Exclude:** Internal PayloadCMS metadata (createdAt, updatedAt preserved but not _id)

**Technical Implementation Approach:**
- Use PayloadCMS Local API for data retrieval: `payload.find()` and `payload.findByID()`
- Implement recursive data fetching for exercise references
- Generate exports via PayloadCMS custom endpoints: `/api/programs/{id}/export`
- Stream large exports to prevent memory issues
- Validate export completeness before generation

**Import Data Processing:**
- **Validation:** Use Zod schemas to validate import JSON structure
- **Conflict Resolution:** Generate new IDs for imported content to avoid conflicts
- **Exercise Matching:** Match imported exercises by title+description to avoid duplicates
- **Error Handling:** 
  - Validate all exercise references exist before program import
  - Partial import recovery: import exercises first, then program
  - Detailed error reporting for failed imports with specific field validation failures
- **Implementation:** Custom endpoint `/api/programs/import` with multipart/form-data support

**Import Validation Requirements:**
- Pre-import validation: Check JSON schema compliance
- Exercise reference validation: Ensure all referenced exercises are available
- Data integrity checks: Validate embedded structure completeness
- Performance validation: Reject imports exceeding realistic program size limits
- User feedback: Provide detailed import progress and error reporting

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Rules:**
- All file names MUST use kebab-case: `programs.ts`, `exercises.ts`
- Use PayloadCMS query methods, never raw MongoDB queries
- Always use YouTube URLs for exercise videos, never direct file uploads
- Use Zod schemas for all API input validation
- Access environment variables through config objects, never process.env directly
