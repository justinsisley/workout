# Story 1.2: PayloadCMS Collections and Embedded Data Structure

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** all PayloadCMS collections defined with embedded program structure,
**so that** the data structure supports efficient admin workflows and eliminates context switching between collections.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Exercises collection** includes title, description, video URL, and alternatives (unchanged)
2. **Programs collection** includes embedded milestones, days, and exercise references in single document
3. **Milestones are embedded in programs** with name, theme, objective, and embedded days array
4. **Days are embedded in milestones** with dayType ('workout'|'rest') and embedded exercises array for workout days
5. **Exercises are referenced by ID** within embedded day structures with complete workout details (sets, reps, rest periods, weight, notes)
6. **Product users collection** includes username, current program, milestone, and day tracking
7. **Exercise completions collection** includes user, exercise, program, milestone index, and day index
8. **All relationships are properly configured** between collections
9. **Collection validation rules** ensure data integrity with progressive validation
10. **Admin interface supports single-page editing** of complete program structure

## Dev Notes

### Embedded Schema Architecture

**Programs Collection Structure:**

```typescript
interface Program {
  id: string
  name?: string
  description?: string
  objective?: string
  milestones: {
    name?: string
    theme?: string
    objective?: string
    days: {
      dayType: 'workout' | 'rest'
      // For workout days: exercises array with complete workout details
      exercises?: {
        exercise: string // Reference to Exercise ID
        sets: number
        reps: number
        restPeriod?: number // Rest time between sets (seconds)
        weight?: number // Weight to use (lbs)
        notes?: string // Additional instructions
      }[]
      // For rest days: optional rest day notes
      restNotes?: string
    }[]
  }[]
  isPublished: boolean
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

**Key Benefits:**

- Single-page editing of complete program structure
- No context switching between collections
- Atomic updates of entire program
- Better data locality and performance
- Simplified admin workflow

**Conditional Logic:**

- **Workout Days:** Show exercises array with sets, reps, rest periods, weight, and notes
- **Rest Days:** Show rest notes field, hide exercises array
- **Exercise References:** Reference Exercise collection by ID, not embedded exercise data
- **Complete Workout Details:** All session-level data (sets, reps, etc.) embedded within day structure

### Implementation Strategy

**Clean Implementation Approach:**

1. Delete existing normalized collections and data
2. Implement new embedded schema collections
3. Test admin interface functionality
4. Validate complete program creation workflow

**Rollback Plan:**

- Revert code changes if needed
- No data migration complexity since starting fresh

### Design Decisions

**Removed `totalWorkoutsCompleted` Field:**

- **Decision**: Removed the `totalWorkoutsCompleted` field from ProductUsers collection
- **Rationale**: This field created data duplication and consistency issues. The total can be calculated dynamically by counting exercise completions, following the single source of truth principle
- **Impact**: Eliminates maintenance overhead and potential data inconsistency issues
- **Alternative**: Calculate workout counts dynamically when needed using exercise completion records

### Testing Requirements

**Collection Testing:**

- Test embedded array functionality
- Test exercise reference relationships
- Test progressive validation
- Test admin interface generation

**Integration Testing:**

- Test complete program creation workflow
- Validate admin interface functionality
- Test TypeScript type safety
