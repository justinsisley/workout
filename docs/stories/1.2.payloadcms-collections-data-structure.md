## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.1 completion:

- PayloadCMS 3.54.0 is successfully integrated with TypeScript support
- MongoDB connection is configured and working via DATABASE_URI environment variable
- PayloadCMS admin interface is accessible at `/admin` route
- Basic collections (users.ts, media.ts) exist and follow kebab-case naming convention
- TypeScript types are generated successfully via payload-types.ts
- Project structure follows PayloadCMS bootstrap conventions with collections in `src/payload/collections/`

### PayloadCMS Collection Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#payloadcms-first-architecture]

**Key Principles:**

- **No Raw MongoDB:** All data structures defined using PayloadCMS field types
- **Field-Based Definition:** Database schema and admin interfaces automatically generated
- **Full Type Safety:** PayloadCMS Local API provides complete TypeScript type safety
- **Relationship Management:** Complex relationships handled through PayloadCMS relationship fields
- **Server-Side Operations:** All data operations use PayloadCMS Local API in server actions

### Progressive Validation Strategy

[Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#progressive-validation-strategy]

**Critical Implementation Requirements:**

- **No Required Fields at Save Time:** All content can be saved in draft state without required fields
- **Publishing Controls:** `isPublished` checkbox controls product user visibility
- **Admin Interface Enhancements:** Field descriptions indicate publishing requirements
- **Save Early, Save Often:** Allow saving content at any stage of completion

### Admin User vs Product User Separation

[Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#admin-user-vs-product-user-separation-strategy]

**Critical Separation Requirements:**

- **PayloadCMS Admin Users (`users` collection):** Standard PayloadCMS authentication (email/password)
- **Product Users (`productUsers` collection):** Custom WebAuthn passkey authentication only, completely separate
- **Security Isolation:** Admin user access and product user access use different authentication systems
- **Data Integrity:** Product user data is isolated from admin user system data

### Collection Definitions and Relationships

[Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#collection-definitions]

**Required Collections:**

1. **ProductUsers Collection:**
   - `username` (text, required, unique, indexed) - serves as both identifier and display name
   - `currentProgram` (relationship to programs)
   - `currentMilestone` (relationship to milestones)
   - `currentDay` (number, default 1)
   - `lastWorkoutDate` (date, optional)
   - `totalWorkoutsCompleted` (number, default 0)
   - Access controls: Only authenticated admin users can manage

2. **Programs Collection:**
   - `name` (text, optional for drafts)
   - `description` (textarea, optional for drafts)
   - `objective` (text, optional for drafts)
   - `culminatingEvent` (relationship to sessions, optional for drafts)
   - `milestones` (array with milestone relationships, drag-and-drop ordering)
   - `isPublished` (checkbox, default false)

3. **Milestones Collection:**
   - `name` (text, optional for drafts)
   - `theme` (text, optional for drafts)
   - `objective` (text, optional for drafts)
   - `culminatingEvent` (relationship to sessions, optional for drafts)
   - `days` (array with dayType: 'workout'|'rest' and session relationships)

4. **Sessions Collection:**
   - `name` (text, optional, admin organization only)
   - `exercises` (array with exercise relationships, sets, reps, restPeriod, weight, notes)
   - Drag-and-drop ordering for exercises within sessions

5. **Exercises Collection:**
   - `title` (text, optional for drafts)
   - `description` (textarea, optional for drafts)
   - `videoUrl` (text, optional for drafts, YouTube URLs)
   - `alternatives` (relationship to exercises, hasMany: true)

6. **ExerciseCompletions Collection:**
   - `productUser` (relationship to productUsers, required)
   - `exercise` (relationship to exercises, required)
   - `session` (relationship to sessions, required)
   - `sets` (number, required)
   - `reps` (number, required)
   - `weight` (number, optional)
   - `time` (number, optional)
   - `completedAt` (date, required)
   - `notes` (textarea, optional)

### File Locations and Naming Conventions

[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md#payloadcms-collections]

**Collection File Locations:**

- All collection files in `src/payload/collections/`
- File naming: kebab-case (e.g., `product-users.ts`, `exercise-completions.ts`)
- Collection slugs: kebab-case (e.g., `productUsers`, `exerciseCompletions`)

**TypeScript Type Generation:**

- Types automatically generated in `src/payload/payload-types.ts`
- Run `npm run generate:types` to regenerate after collection changes
- All server actions and components import types from this file

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]

**Collection Testing Standards:**

- **Test File Location:** `tests/payload/collections.test.ts`
- **Testing Framework:** Vitest for unit and integration tests
- **Test Standards:** All collections must have unit tests for creation, validation, and relationships
- **Testing Patterns:** Use proper mocking for PayloadCMS operations, test both success and error scenarios

**Required Test Coverage:**

- Collection creation and field validation
- Relationship functionality and data integrity
- Access controls and permission systems
- Progressive validation and publishing controls
- TypeScript type generation and compilation

### Technical Constraints

[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]

**PayloadCMS Version:** 3.53+ (currently 3.54.0 installed)
**Database:** MongoDB 7.0+ with Docker Compose for local development
**TypeScript:** 5.3+ with strict type checking enabled
**Validation:** Zod 4.1+ for runtime type validation (already installed)

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Progressive Validation:** All collections must allow saving without required fields initially
2. **Relationship Integrity:** All relationship fields must be properly configured with correct relationTo values
3. **Admin Interface:** Field descriptions must indicate publishing requirements and provide clear guidance
4. **Type Safety:** All collections must generate proper TypeScript types
5. **Access Controls:** ProductUsers collection must have admin-only access controls
6. **File Naming:** All collection files must use kebab-case naming convention
7. **Array Ordering:** Milestone and exercise arrays must support drag-and-drop reordering
8. **Conditional Fields:** Milestone days must show/hide session fields based on dayType

## Testing
