### PayloadCMS Integration Requirements

[Source: architecture.md#payloadcms-collections]

- PayloadCMS should be integrated directly into the Next.js application
- Use PayloadCMS Local API for all data operations
- Configure collections for: users, productUsers, programs, milestones, sessions, exercises, exerciseCompletions
- Set up progressive validation strategy allowing draft content creation
- Implement admin user vs product user separation

### Environment Configuration

[Source: architecture.md#environment-configuration]

Required environment variables:

```bash
# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Backend
DATABASE_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/workout-app
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key
PAYLOAD_SECRET=your-payload-secret-key

# SMS Service (for future stories)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-twilio-account-sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-twilio-auth-token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=your-twilio-phone-number

# Shared
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Docker Compose Setup

[Source: architecture.md#local-development-setup]

MongoDB should be configured with Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: mongo:7.0
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: workout-app
    volumes:
      - mongodb_data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
```

### Testing Requirements

[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Testing Framework:** Vitest for unit/integration tests, Playwright for E2E testing
**Test Organization:**

- Frontend tests in `tests/components/`
- Backend tests in `tests/actions/`
- E2E tests in `tests/e2e/`
  **Test Standards:** All server actions must be tested, components should have unit tests, critical user flows need E2E tests

### Code Quality Standards

[Source: architecture.md#coding-standards]

**File Naming:** All files MUST use kebab-case (non-negotiable)
**TypeScript:** Strict type checking enabled, all components must have TypeScript interfaces
**Error Handling:** All server actions must use proper error handling with Zod validation
**State Management:** Use Zustand for global state, never mutate state directly

### Conventional Commit Standards

**Commit Message Format:** All commits must follow conventional commit format: `type(scope): description`

**Supported Types:**

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process or auxiliary tool changes
- `ci`: CI/CD pipeline changes

**Examples:**

- `feat(auth): add SMS OTP authentication`
- `fix(workout): resolve exercise completion tracking bug`
- `docs(readme): update setup instructions`
- `chore(deps): update dependencies`

**Commitlint Configuration:** Use `@commitlint/config-conventional` with custom rules for project-specific requirements

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Git First Approach:** Initialize Git repository and make first commit BEFORE running `npx create-payload-app`
2. **PayloadCMS Bootstrap:** Use `npx create-payload-app@latest` to bootstrap the application with proper PayloadCMS integration
3. **MongoDB Setup:** Use Docker Compose for local MongoDB development
4. **TypeScript Configuration:** Enable strict mode and configure path aliases for clean imports
5. **Testing Setup:** Configure both Vitest and Playwright for comprehensive testing coverage
6. **Code Quality:** Set up ESLint, Prettier, Lefthook, and commitlint for consistent code quality and commit standards
7. **Project Structure:** Follow the unified project structure from architecture document
8. **Environment Variables:** Set up proper environment configuration with type safety

## Testing

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

**Test File Location:** All tests in `tests/` directory with appropriate subdirectories
**Testing Frameworks:**

- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- Playwright for E2E testing
- Testing Library for React component testing

**Test Standards:**

- All server actions must have unit tests
- Components should have unit tests for critical functionality
- Critical user flows need E2E tests
- Test coverage should be tracked and reported

**Testing Patterns:**

- Use proper mocking for external services
- Test both success and error scenarios
- Include integration tests for PayloadCMS operations
- E2E tests should cover mobile-optimized workflows
