## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:** [Source: 3.1 completion notes]
- Zustand workout store is already implemented with session management, exercise navigation, and AMRAP round tracking
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns established using Tailwind CSS with 44px touch targets
- ShadCN UI components (badge, progress, alert-dialog) are already available and configured
- Existing formatting utilities (`formatDistance`, `formatDuration`) should be used for natural time/distance display
- Type guards (`isAmrapDay`, `hasDistance`, `hasDuration`) are available for conditional rendering
- Testing framework is established with Vitest + Testing Library with comprehensive test patterns

**Data Models:** [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#exercises-collection]
- **Exercise Collection Structure:**
  ```typescript
  interface Exercise {
    id: string
    title?: string // Exercise name
    description?: string // Exercise description and instructions
    videoUrl?: string // YouTube video URL
    alternatives: string[] // Alternative exercise references
    createdAt: Date
    updatedAt: Date
  }
  ```
- **Exercise Configuration in Programs:** [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#programs-collection]
  ```typescript
  interface ExerciseConfig {
    exercise: string // Reference to Exercise ID
    sets: number
    reps: number
    restPeriod?: number // Rest time between sets (seconds)
    weight?: number // Weight to use (lbs)
    durationValue?: number // Duration numeric value (e.g., 1, 30, 5)
    durationUnit?: 'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' // Duration time unit
    notes?: string // Additional instructions
  }
  ```

**Video Integration:** [Source: architecture/components.md#video-integration-components]
- **YouTube Integration Requirements:**
  - Use YouTube iframe API for video embedding and playback
  - Extract video ID from YouTube URLs in exercise.videoUrl field
  - Implement responsive video player with mobile optimization
  - Handle video loading failures with fallback UI
  - Provide play, pause, and seek controls through YouTube API

**File Locations:** [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Exercise detail page: `src/app/(frontend)/workout/exercise/[id]/page.tsx`
- Exercise components: `src/components/workout/exercise-*.tsx`
- Video components: `src/components/workout/*-video.tsx`
- Test files: `tests/components/workout/exercise-*.test.tsx`

**State Management:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#zustand-store-structure]
- **Workout Store Interface:**
  ```typescript
  interface WorkoutState {
    currentProgram: Program | null
    currentMilestoneIndex: number
    currentDayIndex: number
    currentExerciseIndex: number
    completedExercises: string[]
    sessionStartTime: Date | null
    // Navigation helpers already available:
    getCurrentDay: () => EmbeddedDay | null
    getCurrentExercise: () => Exercise | null
    setCurrentExercise: (exerciseIndex: number) => void
    completeExercise: (exerciseId: string) => void
  }
  ```

**UI Component Integration:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-template]
- Use ShadCN UI components for consistent design
- Follow established component template with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Use `cn()` utility for conditional class merging
- Apply 44px minimum touch targets for mobile optimization

**Data Access Pattern:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#server-component-data-fetching]
- Server components should use PayloadCMS Local API for data fetching
- Use `getPayload()` to access PayloadCMS SDK in server components
- Fetch exercises with populated relationships for complete data
- Client components use server actions for data mutations

**Routing Integration:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#route-organization]
- Exercise detail pages use dynamic routing: `/workout/exercise/[id]`
- Implement protected route authentication using `getCurrentProductUser()`
- Add navigation integration with existing workout dashboard and day overview

**Mobile Optimization Requirements:** [Source: 3.1 completion notes]
- Apply mobile-first responsive design patterns across all components
- Use larger touch targets (44px minimum) for touch-friendly interactions
- Implement high-contrast colors and improved visual hierarchy for gym visibility
- Add touch-manipulation CSS for reduced input delays on mobile devices
- Use responsive breakpoints (sm:, lg:) for optimal display across devices

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Use kebab-case for all file names (strictly enforced)
- Server actions for data mutations, PayloadCMS Local API for queries
- Type sharing from `src/types/` directory
- Proper error handling with Zod validation

## Testing

**Test File Locations:** `tests/components/workout/exercise-*.test.tsx` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Vitest + Testing Library for component unit tests
- Focus on business logic: video integration, AMRAP context display, mobile interactions
- Mock YouTube iframe API and PayloadCMS data structures
- Test mobile-optimized UI interactions and touch-friendly elements
- Test accessibility features including keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Exercise data display with various exercise types (time-based, weight-based, bodyweight)
- YouTube video integration including loading states and error handling
- AMRAP context detection and round-based progression display
- Mobile optimization including touch interactions and responsive design
- Video controls functionality (play, pause, seek, fullscreen)
- Accessibility features including keyboard navigation and ARIA labels
- Exercise navigation and routing between exercises in a workout day
- Error handling for missing exercise data or video loading failures
