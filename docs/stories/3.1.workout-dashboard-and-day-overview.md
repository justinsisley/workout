# Story 3.1: Workout Dashboard and Day Overview

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** product user,  
**I want** to see my current workout day overview,  
**so that** I can understand what exercises I need to complete and track my progress through the day.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Day overview display** shows current day's exercises with estimated duration and progress, with AMRAP day detection and specialized round-based display format
2. **Exercise list** displays all exercises in the current day with sets, reps, rest periods, time durations in natural format (e.g., "30 seconds", "5 minutes", "1 hour"), and distances in natural format (e.g., "20 meters", "1 mile", "5 miles")
3. **Progress indicators** show completion status for each exercise in the day, with round-based progress tracking for AMRAP workouts
4. **AMRAP day presentation** displays exercises as rounds with clear indication of "complete all exercises then repeat" flow and time duration remaining
5. **Day navigation** allows users to start the workout and navigate between exercises
6. **Time estimates** display estimated total day duration and time remaining using natural time formatting from exercise duration specifications, with AMRAP timer countdown display
7. **Mobile optimization** provides touch-friendly interface optimized for gym use
8. **Day status tracking** maintains current position within the workout day, including round completion for AMRAP workouts
9. **Exercise preview** shows exercise names and basic information
10. **Day completion tracking** enables tracking of overall day progress
11. **Error handling** gracefully handles day data issues and provides user feedback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
**Program Structure (Embedded Schema):** [Source: architecture/payloadcms-data-architecture.md#programs-collection-schema]
- Programs contain embedded milestones, days, and exercise configurations
- Day fields: `dayType`, `isAmrap`, `amrapDuration`, `restNotes`
- ExerciseConfig fields: `exercise` (relationship), `sets`, `reps`, `restPeriod`, `weight`, `durationValue`, `durationUnit`, `distanceValue`, `distanceUnit`, `notes`
- Single query access to complete program structure via embedded documents

**Product User Progress Tracking:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#payloadcms-local-api-data-access]
- Product users have `currentProgram`, `currentMilestone`, `currentDay` fields for position tracking
- Exercise completions tracked in separate `exerciseCompletions` collection with relationships to exercises and users

### API Specifications
**Server Component Data Fetching:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#server-component-data-fetching]
- Use `getPayload()` and PayloadCMS Local API for type-safe data access
- Server components can directly query PayloadCMS collections without additional API layer
- Authentication via `getCurrentProductUser()` helper function

**Workout Store Integration:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#zustand-store-structure]
- `useWorkoutStore` provides: `currentProgram`, `currentMilestoneIndex`, `currentDayIndex`, `currentExerciseIndex`, `completedExercises`
- Helper methods: `getCurrentDay()`, `getCurrentExercise()`, `setCurrentDay()`, `completeExercise()`
- Session management: `sessionStartTime`, `startSession()` for workout timing

### Component Specifications
**Component Architecture:** [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-organization]
- Workout components located in `src/components/workout/`
- Use ShadCN base components from `src/components/ui/`
- Follow kebab-case file naming convention (required)

**Exercise Display Integration:** [Source: architecture/exercise-formatting-utilities.md#component-integration-patterns]
- Use `formatDistance(distanceValue, distanceUnit)` for distance display
- Use `formatDuration(durationValue, durationUnit)` for time display  
- Use `formatExerciseSpecs(exercise)` for complete exercise specification formatting
- Import from `@/utils/formatters` consolidated export

**Type Safety Patterns:** [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#type-safety-patterns]
- Use `isAmrapDay(day)` type guard for AMRAP day detection
- Use `hasDistance(exercise)` and `hasDuration(exercise)` type guards
- All types auto-generated by PayloadCMS from collection schemas

### File Locations
**Page Location:** `src/app/(frontend)/workout/dashboard/page.tsx` [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**Component Locations:** `src/components/workout/` directory [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**Store Location:** `src/stores/workout-store.ts` (existing) [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**Utility Locations:** `src/utils/formatters.ts` [Source: architecture/exercise-formatting-utilities.md#master-export-file]

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]
- Frontend component tests in `tests/components/workout/` directory
- Use Vitest + Testing Library for React component testing
- Test custom business logic and user interfaces (not framework functionality)
- Focus on exercise formatting, AMRAP detection, and progress tracking logic

**Testing Approach:** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#core-testing-philosophy]
- Do NOT test Next.js routing or PayloadCMS collection operations
- DO test custom React components, formatting utilities, and business logic
- Mock PayloadCMS data and Zustand state for component isolation
- Test AMRAP-specific functionality and exercise display formatting

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Next.js 15.5+ with App Router
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- Tailwind CSS 4.1+ for mobile-first styling
- ShadCN/ui components for consistent UI
- Zustand for state management

**Coding Standards:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- Use kebab-case for all file names (strictly enforced)
- Server actions for data mutations, PayloadCMS Local API for queries
- Type sharing from `src/types/` directory
- Proper error handling with Zod validation

## Testing

**Test File Locations:** `tests/components/workout/` [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Testing Standards:**
- Use Vitest + Testing Library for component unit tests
- Focus on business logic: exercise formatting, AMRAP detection, progress calculations
- Mock PayloadCMS data structures and Zustand store state
- Test mobile-optimized UI interactions and touch-friendly elements

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- AMRAP day detection and round-based display
- Exercise specification formatting with distance and duration
- Progress indicator accuracy for completed vs remaining exercises
- Time estimation calculations for workout duration
- Error handling for missing or invalid day data
