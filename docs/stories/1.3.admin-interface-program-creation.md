5. **Day management validation** - Can create complete program structure with embedded days in milestones
6. **Program creation validation** - Can create programs using the milestone relationships
7. **Rest day management validation** - Can mark days as rest days without session requirements
8. **Data validation system validation** - Progressive validation works correctly for all collection types
9. **Admin interface responsiveness validation** - Interface works correctly on desktop for program creation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 1.2, all PayloadCMS collections are already defined with proper relationships and progressive validation. The collections are ready for admin interface usage and validation.

### Validation Approach

This story serves as a comprehensive validation checklist for the PayloadCMS setup from Story 1.2. The bottom-up workflow approach (exercises → sessions → milestones → programs) aligns with the natural admin workflow and ensures proper validation of all collection relationships and functionality.

**Key Validation Principles:**

- Test each collection type individually before testing relationships
- Follow the natural dependency order (exercises first, programs last)
- Validate both individual functionality and end-to-end workflows
- Use the story as a checklist to ensure complete validation coverage

### Data Models

**Programs Collection Structure:**

- Fields: name, description, objective, culminatingEvent (relationship to sessions), milestones (array with milestone relationships), isPublished (checkbox)
- Progressive validation: All fields optional at save time, required for publishing
- Milestone ordering: Array-based with drag-and-drop reordering
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#programs-collection]

**Milestones Collection Structure:**

- Fields: name, theme, objective, culminatingEvent (relationship to sessions), days (array)
- Days array: dayType ('workout'|'rest'), sessions (conditional array for workout days only)
- Progressive validation: All fields optional at save time
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#milestones-collection]

**Sessions Collection Structure:**

- Fields: name (optional), exercises (array with exercise relationships)
- Exercise fields: exercise (relationship), sets, reps, restPeriod, weight, notes
- Standalone entities: Can be reused across different milestones and days
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#sessions-collection]

**Exercises Collection Structure:**

- Fields: title, description, videoUrl, alternatives (many-to-many relationship)
- Progressive validation: All fields optional at save time
- Video integration: YouTube URLs for exercise demonstrations
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#exercises-collection]

**Users Collection (Admin Users):**

- Standard PayloadCMS authentication with email/password
- No custom fields - uses PayloadCMS defaults
- Access controls: Only authenticated admin users can manage all collections
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#users-collection-payloadcms-admin-users]

### API Specifications

**PayloadCMS Local API Integration:**

- Use `getPayload()` for all data operations
- Direct database access with full type safety
- No need for custom REST/GraphQL APIs
- Server actions use PayloadCMS Local API for mutations
  [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#payloadcms-local-api-data-access]

**Admin Access Controls:**

- All collections require authenticated admin user for CRUD operations
- Access control pattern: `({ req: { user } }) => !!user`
- Product users have no access to admin interface
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#admin-user-vs-product-user-separation-strategy]

### Component Specifications

**PayloadCMS Admin Interface:**

- Automatically generated from collection definitions
- Drag-and-drop ordering for array fields and relationships
- Conditional field display based on field conditions
- Progressive validation with clear completion indicators
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#payloadcms-first-architecture]

**Admin Interface Features:**

- Field descriptions indicate publishing requirements
- Warning messages for incomplete published content
- Bulk actions for publishing multiple items
- Responsive design for desktop admin workflows

### Testing Requirements

**Backend Testing:**

- Test PayloadCMS collection configurations
- Test admin authentication and access controls
- Test CRUD operations for all collections
- Test relationship management and validation
- Test progressive validation behavior
  [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-tests]

**Test File Locations:**

  [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]

**Testing Frameworks:**

- Vitest for unit and integration tests
- PayloadCMS Local API for testing data operations
- Test progressive validation with incomplete and complete data
  [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#testing-pyramid]

### Technical Constraints

**Progressive Validation Strategy:**

- No required fields at save time - all content can be saved in draft state
- `isPublished` checkbox controls product user visibility
- Field descriptions indicate publishing requirements
- Admin users can work on multiple items simultaneously
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#progressive-validation-strategy]

**Admin User Separation:**

- PayloadCMS admin users use standard email/password authentication
- Product users use WebAuthN passkey authentication (separate system)
- Admin users have no access to product user workout data
- Clear separation of concerns between admin and product user systems
  [Source: architecture/payloadcms-collections.md#admin-user-vs-product-user-separation-strategy]

**Technology Stack Requirements:**

- PayloadCMS 3.53+ for admin interface generation
- MongoDB 7.0+ for data storage
- TypeScript 5.3+ for type safety
- Next.js 15.5+ for full-stack framework
