# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Personal Workout App**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on the PRD and project brief, this is a **greenfield project** with no existing starter templates. The project will be built from scratch using:

- **Next.js** as the primary framework
- **PayloadCMS** integrated directly into the Next.js application
- **MongoDB** for data storage
- **Tailwind CSS + ShadCN** for UI components

This approach provides maximum flexibility and simplicity for a single-developer personal project.
