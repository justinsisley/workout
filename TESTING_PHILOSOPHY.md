# Testing Philosophy

## Framework Testing Policy

**Core Principle**: We do not test well-established, comprehensively tested open-source frameworks.

### PayloadCMS Testing Stance

**We DO NOT test:**

- PayloadCMS collection configuration objects
- PayloadCMS admin interface functionality
- PayloadCMS field types, relationships, or admin UI behavior
- PayloadCMS authentication or CRUD operations

**Rationale:**

- PayloadCMS collection configurations are strongly-typed configuration objects
- The PayloadCMS team maintains comprehensive test coverage for their framework
- Testing framework functionality provides zero business value
- Resources are better spent testing our actual business logic

### What We DO Test

**Business Logic & Custom Code:**

- Custom validation functions and business rules
- API endpoints and custom route handlers
- Custom React components and user interfaces
- Data transformation and business process logic
- Integration points between our code and external services

**User Workflows:**

- End-to-end user journeys through our custom features
- Critical business processes and user interactions
- Performance characteristics of our custom implementations

### Testing Strategy

1. **Trust the Framework** - Well-tested frameworks don't need our validation
2. **Test Business Value** - Focus on code that delivers unique business functionality
3. **Integration Over Configuration** - Test how our code integrates with frameworks, not the frameworks themselves
4. **User-Centric** - Test what users actually experience through our custom features

### Implementation Notes

- TypeScript compilation serves as configuration validation for PayloadCMS
- Framework documentation and community provide configuration guidance
- Our tests should focus on custom logic, not framework verification

This philosophy applies to all well-established frameworks we integrate (Next.js, React, etc.) - we test our code, not theirs.
